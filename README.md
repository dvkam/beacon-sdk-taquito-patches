# Beacon SDK (ECAD-maintained line)

> **This repository is the ECAD-maintained Beacon SDK package line.**
>
> It descends from [airgap-it/beacon-sdk](https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-sdk),
> the original upstream Beacon project. ECAD publishes this line under the neutral
> `@ecadlabs/beacon-*` npm scope and uses it to support Taquito and related
> integrations.
>
> We also track [trilitech/octez.connect](https://github.com/trilitech/octez.connect),
> which continues the same SDK line under the `@tezos-x/*` scope. We may
> selectively import changes from that line when they fit our needs, while
> continuing to publish and support `@ecadlabs/beacon-*`.
>
> Where ECAD ports fixes from published `octez.connect` releases, we aim to keep
> that provenance explicit in our documentation, review notes, and history.
>
> A future move to `@tezos-x/*` packages remains possible, but it is not the
> default assumption for this repository today.
>
> ### Current branch and package strategy
>
> | Item | Role |
> |------|------|
> | `taquito-patches` | Main ECAD maintenance branch for the package line. |
> | `fix/*` | Short-lived ECAD fix branches when a focused patch is easier to stage separately. |
> | `@ecadlabs/beacon-*` | Public package names published from this repo. |
> | `trilitech` remote | External maintenance line we evaluate for import candidates. |
> | `upstream` remote | Historical AirGap lineage reference. |
>
> ### Release and review posture
>
> - Pull requests are the expected integration path for `taquito-patches`
> - CI runs on both `push` and `pull_request`
> - npm publication is handled from this repository through GitHub Actions using
>   npm Trusted Publishers, not long-lived npm automation tokens
> - We do not keep a root `CHANGELOG.md` that only redirects to external notes
> - Workspace versioning is synchronized from the root manifest into every
>   published package before release
> - Prerelease versions publish under the prerelease identifier as the npm
>   dist-tag, for example `4.8.1-ecad.4` publishes under `ecad`

### Published packages

Primary entry points:

- `@ecadlabs/beacon-sdk`
- `@ecadlabs/beacon-dapp`
- `@ecadlabs/beacon-wallet`

Lower-level packages also published from this repo:

- `@ecadlabs/beacon-types`
- `@ecadlabs/beacon-core`
- `@ecadlabs/beacon-utils`
- `@ecadlabs/beacon-ui`
- `@ecadlabs/beacon-transport-matrix`
- `@ecadlabs/beacon-transport-postmessage`
- `@ecadlabs/beacon-transport-walletconnect`
- `@ecadlabs/beacon-blockchain-tezos`
- `@ecadlabs/beacon-blockchain-tezos-sapling`

### How Taquito consumes this

Taquito currently depends on `@ecadlabs/beacon-*` packages directly. This keeps
the supported Beacon integration under ECAD control while leaving room to
reassess package sourcing in the future.

### Publishing a new version

1. Apply or merge the desired fix on `taquito-patches`
2. Set the release version, for example:
   `npm version 4.8.1-ecad.N --no-git-tag-version && npm run version:sync`
3. Refresh package README files: `npm run readmes:sync`
4. Refresh the lockfile: `npm install --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts`
5. Tag and push: `git tag v4.8.1-ecad.N && git push origin taquito-patches --tags`
6. GitHub Actions publishes the `@ecadlabs/beacon-*` packages to the public npm registry through npm Trusted Publishers

### Reassessing package sourcing

If the external maintenance line becomes stable and appropriate for our needs,
ECAD may choose to consume or adopt a different package line in the future.
That decision should be made explicitly and separately from routine patch work.

> Connect wallets with dApps on Tezos

[Beacon](https://walletbeacon.io) is the implementation of the wallet interaction standard [TZIP-10](https://gitlab.com/tzip/tzip/blob/master/proposals/tzip-10/tzip-10.md), which describes communication between a dApp and a wallet.

## Intro

The `beacon-sdk` simplifies and abstracts communication between dApps and
wallets over different transport layers.

Developers building more complex smart contract interactions can use
[Taquito](https://github.com/ecadlabs/taquito) with `BeaconWallet`, which uses
this SDK under the hood and provides higher-level contract interaction helpers.

Besides this TypeScript SDK, there are also native Beacon SDKs for iOS and Android wallets:

- [Beacon Android SDK (Kotlin)](https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-android-sdk)
- [Beacon iOS SDK (Swift)](https://github.com/airgap-it/beacon-ios-sdk)

## Installation

```sh
npm install @ecadlabs/beacon-sdk
```

## Example dApp integration

```ts
import { BeaconEvent, DAppClient } from '@ecadlabs/beacon-sdk'

const dAppClient = new DAppClient({ name: 'My Sample DApp' })

dAppClient.subscribeToEvent(BeaconEvent.ACTIVE_ACCOUNT_SET, async (account) => {
  console.log(`${BeaconEvent.ACTIVE_ACCOUNT_SET} triggered: `, account)
})

try {
  console.log('Requesting permissions...')
  const permissions = await dAppClient.requestPermissions()
  console.log('Got permissions:', permissions.address)
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Got error:', error)
}
```

For a more complete example, see [`examples/dapp.html`](./examples/dapp.html).

## dApp event correlation

Request SENT events include `requestId`, `requestType`, `transport`, and the target
peer's `senderId` when known. Narrow `dispatchStage` before reading the timestamp:

- `transport`: `sentAt` records when transport send was invoked. The event is
  emitted after that call completes; it does not confirm wallet delivery.
- `forwarded`: `forwardedAt` records when a follower tab forwarded the request to
  its leader. `transport` identifies the intended wallet transport. There is no
  `sentAt`, since the follower has not sent the request to the wallet.

SUCCESS and ERROR events include top-level `requestId` and `receivedAt`.
`receivedAt` records response arrival at this client, before asynchronous metadata
or account preparation. For local timeouts and aborts, it records local settlement.
All timestamps are epoch milliseconds. Correlate by ID rather than event arrival
order. An error before request admission can have an empty ID and no preceding
SENT event. V3 correlation uses the outer Beacon envelope ID.

ACK events distinguish real protocol acknowledgements from WalletConnect pairing
status. Narrow `correlated` before accessing `message` or `requestId`:

```ts
await dAppClient.subscribeToEvent(BeaconEvent.ACKNOWLEDGE_RECEIVED, (ack) => {
  if (ack.correlated) {
    console.log('Wallet acknowledged', ack.requestId, ack.message)
  } else {
    console.log('WalletConnect pairing is pending', ack.receivedAt)
  }
})
```

`ACTIVE_ACCOUNT_SET` is typed as `AccountInfo | undefined`, matching account
selection and clearing. Subscribers must handle the cleared case. These ACK and
account type corrections require consumers that assumed a message or account was
always present to update their callbacks. Code constructing event payloads must
also supply the new correlation fields and dispatch discriminator.

## Example wallet integration

```ts
import {
  BeaconMessageType,
  PermissionResponseInput,
  PermissionScope,
  WalletClient
} from '@ecadlabs/beacon-sdk'

const client = new WalletClient({ name: 'My Wallet' })
await client.init()

client
  .connect(async (message) => {
    if (message.type === BeaconMessageType.PermissionRequest) {
      const response: PermissionResponseInput = {
        type: BeaconMessageType.PermissionResponse,
        network: message.network,
        scopes: [PermissionScope.OPERATION_REQUEST],
        id: message.id,
        publicKey: 'tezos public key'
      }

      await client.respond(response)
    }
  })
  .catch((error) => console.error('connect error', error))
```

For a more complete example, see [`examples/wallet.html`](./examples/wallet.html).

## Adding a wallet to Beacon SDK

Please create a PR and add your wallet in
[`scripts/blockchains/tezos.mjs`](./scripts/blockchains/tezos.mjs).

For iOS wallets, the wallet needs to define a custom URL scheme to support same-device functionality.

## Development

```sh
npm ci
npm run check:versions
npm run build
npm run test
npm run e2e
```

Once the SDK is built, you can open [`examples/dapp.html`](./examples/dapp.html) or
[`examples/wallet.html`](./examples/wallet.html) in your
browser and try the basic functionality. To support browser extensions, the
examples should be served over HTTP rather than opened directly from disk.

## Node.js support

CI builds and tests the SDK on Node.js 22, 24 and 26 LTS. Dependency installs
use npm 11.12.1.
Use Node.js 24 for local development and release tooling. The minimum
workspace version remains Node.js 22.12.0. Maintenance LTS releases remain
supported; end-of-life and Current releases are outside the tested matrix.

See [Node.js support](docs/node-support.md) for installed package checks and
how Node loads imports.
